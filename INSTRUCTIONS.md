Setup
    After cloning this repo, please go ahead and run "npm i". Once you've done that, everything should be ready to go. Now, unfortunately I didn't include anything to help with the frontend development to prevent the whole refresh thing, but that's okay. You'll just have to remember to manually refresh everything yourself. If you encounter ANY problems during this step, please feel free to shoot me a message. 

Task: 
    As we've discussed, all you have to do is build the pages you see in the "images" folder. Please be sure to add dropdown menus were necessary (ex: signout) and make sure eveything works as expected. There should also be a modal in one of the designs and it would be nice to have that too. No matter what you do, DO NOT START WITH THE DESIGN ELEMENT OF THINGS. CONSOLE. CONSOLE. CONSOLE. 

    Index page:
        Just load all of the movies. This part shouldn't be too hard for you. Don't forget to add the signIn option.
            hint: has to do with local storage and objects. 

    Home page: 
        This page is the home of the user. This place has the same movies from the previous page, except with the ability to add movies to your list. This page is also known as the "info" page since it will be where users will be clicking and adding things to their list. On this page, users should also be able to click a movie, something should come up contianing all of the required details. Remember: CONSOLE FIRST. ALWAYS. 

    MyMovies page
        This page is the real challenge. One this page a user's movie list presents itself in sections known as Genres. The scroll shout be horizontal and users should be able to remove movies from their list from this page.  



Extras: 
    run this command in the terminal: "run start"

    Don't forget to add the button that takes you to the other page on the "Home" page. 

   * This goes without saying: 
        every page that is not the index page should give one the ability to logout. It would also be great if a user can only add unique movies. Meaning te same EXTACT movies cannot me added twice. And like always: CONSOLES!
            hint: Arrays

    Remember: The console is your second to only friend. If things don't work in the console, forget about it working anywhere else. 


    I've though about this and I can help. But I can only help you on two topics for not more than 5 minutes each. 

    Good Luck! And remember: CONSOLE CONSOLE CONSOLE. If you can't get it working in text, you can kiss everything else goodbye. Cheers!
